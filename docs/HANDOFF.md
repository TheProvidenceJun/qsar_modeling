# Project Handoff

## Current Status
Phase 1: Data Preparation & Split has been completed successfully.
- The QDB.177 `M2.logKoc` endpoint was parsed from `data/raw/properties/M2.logKoc/values`.
- Raw compound identifiers were mapped to SMILES files under `data/raw/compounds/<Compound Id>/daylight-smiles`.
- RDKit validation and canonicalization secured 642 unique valid compounds from 643 raw entries.
- A Y-Ranking 80/20 split was generated with zero SMILES overlap between Training and Test sets.

## Active Project
- **Project:** QSAR logKoc Modeling Project
- **Dataset:** QDB.177, Gramatica et al. 2014
- **Target property:** logKoc
- **Main objective:** Build and validate an ensemble/consensus QSAR model.
- **Original benchmark:** Test R² = 0.794

## Current Phase
**Phase 2: Mordred Descriptor Extraction**
This is the next action.

## Next Action
Create and execute the Phase 2 notebook:
`notebooks/02_mordred_extract.ipynb`

## Completed Tasks
1. Parsed the QDB.177 logKoc endpoint (`M2.logKoc`) and constructed a unified dataset containing `SMILES` and `logKoc`.
2. Validated and canonicalized SMILES using RDKit.
3. Removed invalid/disconnected structures and duplicate canonical SMILES. The raw set contained 643 entries; 1 duplicate was removed; 642 compounds were secured for modeling.
4. Applied Y-Ranking by sorting compounds according to `logKoc` and assigning every fifth ranked compound to the external Test set.
5. Saved the processed datasets:
   - `data/processed/train.csv` with 514 compounds
   - `data/processed/test.csv` with 128 compounds
6. Confirmed zero data leakage between Training and Test sets based on canonical SMILES overlap.

## Phase 1 Outputs
- `data/processed/train.csv`
- `data/processed/test.csv`

## Environment For Next Step
Recommended environment:
```bash
conda activate mordred
```
